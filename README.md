# React-Redux-and-TypeScript-Tutorial

Just finished tutorial for React, Redux and TypeScript.

Almost the same setup with React and Redux like in his tutorial for React Redux, just with TypeScript now.

I still have this feeling I am missing something from TypeScript. I did finish tutorials, I am reading documentations,
but, I will do few more tutorials on Typescript and few on Angular so I can start making projects in Angular.

Anyway, need to create Markdown Readme Template, so
onwards to another project!
